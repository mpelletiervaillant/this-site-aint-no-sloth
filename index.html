    <p class="gutter-1-2">Sloth are mammals classfied in the families <i>Megaolonychidae</i> (two-toed sloths) and <i>Bradypodidae</i> (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy.</p>

    <p class="gutter-1-2">Aside form their surprising speed during emergency flights from predators, other natable traits of sloths include their strong body an their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs.</p>

    <p class="gutter-1-2">They are classidied in the order Pilosa because they are related to anteaters, which sport a similar set of specialized claws. Extinct sloth species include many megafaunal ground sloths, some of which attained the size of elephants, as well as a few species of marine sloths. Extant sloths are medium-sized arboreal (tree-dwelling) residents of the jungles of Central and South America.</p>

    <p class="gutter-1-2">Sloths make good habitats for other organisms, and a single sloth may be home to moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, ciliates, and algae.</p>
